Javascript is both scripting and programming language. As a web perspective, it is a scripting language.

client side--> browser. It is responsible for the behavior and interactivity of a web page like DOM manupulation, event handling and so on.
Environment: Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

server side--> can be connected to database.  Server-side JavaScript runs on a web server. It is responsible for handling requests from the client, processing data, and generating responses.
Environment: Server (e.g., Node.js runtime)

package.json --> a file that describes our project

package-lock.json --> a file that describes the packages(npm) used in the project

library --> react

framework --> laravel, express, angular, vuejs

environment --> nodejs

Library vs framework
The framework calls the developer's code, whereas in a library, the developer calls the library's code.
For example, a library might be designed to handle user input, interact with a database, or perform data parsing. In contrast, frameworks are designed to provide a wide range of functionality and are often used to build complete applications.

Almost every nodejs project uses express js

versioning of packages are in semantic(semVer)
Example: major.minor.patch (1.2.3)

// Port Number--> 0 to 65535. Port numbers identify a particular application or service on a system. Same port number cannot be used. It is convinient to use the port numbers greater than 1000 as 0-1000 is used by the internal system

What Can Node.js Do?
--> Node.js can generate dynamic page content
--> Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
--> Node.js can collect form data
--> Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database

Note:--> "node --watch program_name" to access the program written in node environment in the browser automatically
         "npm init" to make a json package
